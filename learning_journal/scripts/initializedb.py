     learned about web frameworks and in particular how to use Pyramid.
     We went pretty quickly over this so I got a little lost in class but
     doing it twice for both me and my partner's learning journal was great
     practice. We also learned about deploying simple python apps to heroku.
     I had a surprsing amount of difficulty with this. after a lot of
     frustration I realized t was a problem with my file tree setup.
     Luckily I was able to get my site up and running.<br>
            I'm really enjoying the data structures at the moment.
     I feel like the more we do the easier it is for me to get
     my head around how they work and what they could be used for.
     Today was a deque which was similar to a queue and a double
     linked list.""",

     this would shorten the time needed to sort data compated to just looping
     through a normal list. I found it hard to get my head around not using
     nodes when we implemented it using a list in python.<br>
     We also learned about jinja2 today and using it as a templating system for
     a website. I think initially I was a little freaked out by jinja when I
     did the reading but now that I've had the chance to practise and implement
     it in this site I feel like I'm starting to get the hang of it. """},
